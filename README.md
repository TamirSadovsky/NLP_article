# Local Citation Recommendation - Advancing Prefetching: A Comparative Analysis of Encoding Techniques for Citation Retrieval

<!--Maybe you want to add it: Welcome to our NLP project at Tel Aviv University, where we explore innovative encoding techniques for the prefetching step and introduce substantial enhancements to the dataset originally utilized in the referenced article. -->


Welcome to our NLP project at Tel Aviv University, focused on different approaches to improve performance of existing techniques found in the [original project](https://github.com/nianlonggu/Local-Citation-Recommendation). For detailed information, please refer to our comprehensive PDF article.

## Project Data

All of our newly generated data and the Python code responsible for their creation are located in the directory: **data/custom/new_data**.

We obtained all this data using the Semantic Scholar API. To utilize the API effectively, make sure to obtain an API key through their website.

To leverage our new data or a subset of it, you can access the pre-existing JSON file with titles already appended: **papers_with_additional_fields.json**.

If you wish to modify the existing data or select specific fields for your use, you can start with **papers_metadata.json**.

For those interested in generating new data and appending it to the existing corpus within **papers.json**, we've provided a helpful mapping of paper IDs. This mapping can be used with the Semantic Scholar API.

Detailed instructions for these processes can be found in our PDF document.

## Running the Baseline Code

To execute the baseline code, kindly follow the instructions provided in the [original project repository](https://github.com/nianlonggu/Local-Citation-Recommendation).

Thank you for exploring our project! For any questions or additional information, please refer to our PDF or reach out to our team.
